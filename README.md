# hello :3
Don't really know how to write or format these but Hi!

[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=blankochan&theme=radical)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I'm a 16 year old self taught developer and sys admin enthusiast (I can and will infodump about random little things if someone expresses any interest at all)
I don't really have much that I've contributed to FOSS, but I've pinned below stuff that I've worked on that I feel confident in sharing
