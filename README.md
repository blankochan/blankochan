# hello :3
Don't really know how to write or format these but Hi!

I'm a 17 year old self taught developer and sys admin enthusiast (I can and will infodump about random little things if someone expresses any interest at all)
I don't really have much that I've contributed to FOSS, but I've pinned below stuff that I've worked on that I feel confident in sharing
